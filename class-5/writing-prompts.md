## Runtime styling
What do we mean when we talk about a program’s “lifecycle?”
  *Program lifecycle is used to describe the sequence of steps used to create a program, including coding?

What does “runtime” mean?
  *Runtime is being able to style a map specific to your user based on interaction or context. If the user wants to view a map in satellite mode or in road style they can choose that on the spot and the map would adjust accordingly. 

## Lesson recap
In JavaScript, what is a function and when might you want to create one?
  *A function in Javascript is a procedure or set of statements that performs a certain task. Functions may be used to calculate values or pull information from variables that contain a large amount of information. It makes it easier for the user to create a function that spits out specific information rather than looking refering back to them manually. 

In CSS, what is the difference between a class and an id?
  *A class can be used to identify a variety of elements where an id can be used to identify only one. Styling information for multiple objects would be done using a class.

In HTML, does the order of elements matter? Why?
  *HTML element order isn't essential in order to run a working code. But it is important to list them in the correct order so the map will load first and then other elements. This is more preference. In CSS, however, element order matters. 

When might you need to use an array? How about an object?
  *Objects are used to represent a variable in coding. This variable can contain characteristics or properties that consist of key:value pairs. Such as information on the various dogs you walk for your dog walking buisness. With objects you can access properties of your variable using a dot or bracket. An array is used to create and store a list of items in one variable or loop through items. An array can store strings, numbers, objects or other arrays.
