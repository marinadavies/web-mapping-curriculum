## Intro to interactivity

### What are some strategies interactive map developers can use to ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming?
* To ensure maps with a lot of interactions are not overwhelming, the developer can create popups or have additional information downloadable so that the user can pick and choose what they want to take away from the map without having it all out at once. The developer can also have multiple interations as options so the user can choose what makes the most sense to them and whatever they are researching. 

### Why do we use the term “map user” instead of “map reader?”
* In web mapping, map users are the audience the map designer had in mind when creating an interactive map. Old school maps, like cartography, were printed so the people using the map were "reading it". With digital and web mapping, it makes more sense to say map user because people are interactiving with the map in live time rather than reading it. 

## Common types of interaction
* Common types of interactions include: popups, search bar, geolocation button, pan/zoom, zoom/pan/fly to, tilt and rotate. 

### What is geocoding and how might you add it to an interactive map?
* Geocoding is the process of turning human-readable search terms into mappable coodinates. Geocoding allows map users to enter a word or phrase, such as "banana split", into mappable coordinates that show the user what stores or locations have banana splits. Geocoding is normally never free so if you want to add it to a map you will need an account with Google, Mapbox, or any other provider that offers this service. 

## Intro to events

### What is an event?
* An event is an object or key value pairs that contains information about something that just happened. Event driven programs are web applications that respond to user actions. For example, when a website requests your location a popup will appear and when you give it permission, the browser finds your geolocation. 

### Describe an example of how you could use an event listener with an interactive map.
* An example of an event listener is when you are on google maps and search for coffee shops. When the user clicks on a marker the event listeners job is to make sure that a popup of the coffee shop info is shown.
