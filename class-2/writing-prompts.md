# What is the difference between raster and vector data?
* Raster tiles are images and plain HTML elements that can be manipulated and rendered on the fly. Vector data can be stored in vector tiles. With vector tiles, you only store data and code rules for how you want the map to look like. Rendering vector tiles happens at the end. 

# Why do "slippy maps" exist?
* Slippy maps exist because it makes it easier for the user to see adjacent areas or tiles near their point of interest. Previously, if an address bordered the edge of one tile, it would be hard for the user to find it on any other tile. Slippy maps have multiple zoom levels so it makes it easier for users to find places in the world.
