### Cartography 

Color plays a significant role in the visualization of map data. What are some important considerations to keep in mind when choosing the appropriate color scheme for your map?
  * You should think about the audience, format, and purpose of your map when choosing the appropriate color scheme for your map. You should also think about the color-wheel and what colors will be best to describe what your map is saying without clashing. 

Why might you want to avoid using a rainbow color scheme?
  * The rainbow color scheme is commonly missused on maps. They use qualitative colors to show diverging data so there is often misinterpresentation when using the rainbow color scheme. 

List and describe 2-3 different thematic map types
  * Sequential type: shows colors go from low to high, or light to dark. The dark colors are suppose to represent high quantities of the data, such as who uses the most internet around the world. 
  * Qualitative type: Uses differences in color to represent nominal differences. An example is to use different colors when showing where various candidates have the most supporters throughout the country. 

What type of data is appropriately respresented by a sequential color scheme? What about a diverging color scheme?
  * Sequential and diverging color schemes normally represent nominal or quantitative data. 

Can you name any tools (either from the presentation or your web travels) that would be helpful for choosing colors?
  * I would use the color wheel. In intro to GIS, the color wheel was a good tool to use when trying to figure out what colors would represent your data. For example, colors on the opposite side of the wheel can show contrasting data.
