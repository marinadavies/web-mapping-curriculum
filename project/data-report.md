## California Wildland Fires: Identifying Wildland Urban Interface Zones, Current Threats and Management Status 
Marina Davies, Leala Lingo 


The intensity and size of wildfires in California have significantly increased since the 1980s (CDFW, 2020). In recent years, wildfires have been the deadliest, most destructive, costliest, and largest in state history (Forest Climate Action Team, 2018). Therefore, a map including current wildfire threat and management status will provide citizens of California and local agencies valuable information. The objective of our map is to illustrate Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) zones, current wildfire threats, and land management status across the state. The intention is that users interested in this map will click on a county within California, which will activate a zoom feature to that area. Within each county, we will illustrate our three parameters (WUI zones, current wildfire threat, management agency) so that users can have a better understanding on how counties across California compare to each other. 

Dataset sources: 
  * WUI zones in California layer by CalFire - https://frap.fire.ca.gov/mapping/gis-data/
  * Fire Threat layer by CalFire- https://frap.fire.ca.gov/mapping/gis-data/
  * County Boundaries by California Department of Technology- https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-geographic-boundaries
  * California Wildland Fire Direct Protection Areas 2019 layer by U.S. Forest Service - https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ce2d26d06f4245afb1297734a5a018e9

Dataset meaning, purpose, barriers, additional datasets:
  * WUI Zones - The purpose of the WUI Zones dataset is to illustrate transitional areas from wildland to urban landscape. This is important for both citizens and local agencies in identifying areas that are within close proximity to lands prone to wildland fires. For citizens, this may be critical information when looking to purchase a home. For local agencies, this information may influence building code for homes within WUI areas and may aid in developing wildfire management goals or plans. We hope that these can be represented as hollow polygons within the county view so users can easily identify WUI zones within their county. 
  * Fire Threat - The fire threat layer is a product of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). It is a final product of data sets combining expected fire frequency and history predicting fire behavior. The layer shows four threat classes, ranking the areas most to least vulnerable to forest fires. The purpose behind including this layer is to provide the user with a visual representation of the areas which have been deemed by fire specialists as potentially high wildland fire sites. This data is provided in raster format and will have little interaction other than to show what CA FRAP has assessed for different areas.
  * County Boundaries - County Boundaries are necessary for the user’s situational awareness while panning around the map while zoomed in. Normally, these boundaries also correspond to responsible management agencies (discussed below) and will supplement the user’s geographic understanding of the fire data being displayed.
  * California Wildland Fire Direct Protection Areas (2019) - The California Wildland Fire Direct Protection Area layer provides the user with information on what agency (federal, state, local) is responsible for managing and suppressing wildland fire throughout the state. Since each agency likely has different methods of land management, this provides the user with the ability to understand who is responsible for managing land in the area of interest. The user can then research agencies in their area and learn current/proposed fire management strategies, such as prescribed burning, removal of invasive species, and planting of fire-resilient species.
  * Other layers considered but rejected included information like historic fire boundaries of varying sizes (i.e. 5,000+ or 100,000+ acres), causes and duration of each fire, and associated vegetation types. While there were barriers to including these layers, for example integration concerns within the map, it was ultimately deemed that the raw fire data was of less use to an end user (general public, politicians), and that providing instead refined data provided by CA FRAP’s fire scientists was more useful and required less knowledge on the part of the user. The final set of layers to be used in the map were carefully selected to convey the most useful information to the end user, require the least amount of knowledge before using the map, and ultimately capture the need-to-know facts for someone interested in a particular area.

Methodology: 
The data layers selected need transformation as they are vector and raster datasets. Each dataset will be simplified to remove excess information (i.e. coding internal to the department providing the data), and to make labels uniform for similar data across data sets. We will need to convert these datasets to geojson and then edit them on geojson.io if needed. From there we will need to create a code to encompass all parts of our interactive map. Listed below is our methodology for each layer. 
	
  * WUI Zones - WUI zones will be displayed as hollow polygons. These zones will only be visible at the county level. When the user clicks on an area, the information will populate an HTML box overlayed on the map. Along with all other data discussed below, the webpage containing the web map will have a small section below the map describing what WUI zones represent, along with citing the source for the information.
  * Current Threat Status - Current Threat Status will be displayed as the main base layer with a fill color corresponding to the threat status (1-4). This layer’s data will also be called and displayed in a box when the user clicks on any location inside the map area. For reference a scale will be included on the map so a user can easily understand the color scheme without needing to click on the map.
  * County Boundaries - County Boundaries will be displayed as hollow, labeled polygons, with the stylistic emphasis of showing the user the name of the counties being viewed and where boundaries are between counties for situational awareness. This layer’s data will be similarly called and zoomed to when a user clicks on the map. When the map zooms in on the county, threat status, WUI zone, and management agency will be available for the user to interact with. When a user clicks on an area of the map, the map will generate threat status level and management agency for that area of the map. 
  * Management Agency - Management Agency will not be visually represented on the map, but instead will only be a callable layer to provide the user with the information of which agency controls the clicked portion of the map. Inclusion of the visual representation of management agencies will likely clutter the map and take away from the most important geographic information of WUI and current threat status, and would confuse our situational awareness county boundaries layer.
